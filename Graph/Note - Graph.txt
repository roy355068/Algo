Comparison between        Adjacency Matrix     Adjacency List
1. Space complexity:         O(|V| ^ 2)          O(|E| + |V|)
2. Access speed:            continuous mem     dynamically allocated
3. Create new edges:           O(1)             O(|E|) in worst case
4. Delete new edges:           O(1)             O(|E|) in worst case
